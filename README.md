# SpaceX-Falcon-9-Data-Science-Project    
In this Project:
1. We were able to predict if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully.
2. We collected data on the Falcon 9 first-stage landings. 
3. We used a RESTful API and web scraping. And converted the data into a data frame and then perform some data wrangling.
4. We build a dashboard to analyze launch records interactively with Plotly Dash. 
5. And then we build an interactive map to analyze the launch  site proximity with Folium.
6. We also used machine learning to determine if the first stage of Falcon 9 will land successfully. We split the data into training data and test data to find the best Hyperparameter for SVM, Classification Trees, and Logistic Regression. 
7. Then found the method that performs best using test data.
